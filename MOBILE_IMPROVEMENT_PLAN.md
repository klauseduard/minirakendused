# ðŸ“± Gardening Calendar App: Mobile Usability & Photo Capture Plan

## Goals

1. **Mobile-First Responsive Design**
   - Ensure all UI elements are touch-friendly and adapt to small screens.
   - Optimize layout, font sizes, and navigation for mobile.
2. **Seamless Photo Capture**
   - Allow users to take photos directly from their device camera when adding journal entries.
   - Improve photo preview and management UX on mobile.
3. **General Mobile Usability Enhancements**
   - Sticky/floating action buttons for key actions.
   - Simplified navigation (e.g., bottom nav bar or collapsible menus).
   - Larger tap targets and better spacing.
   - Fast access to frequently used features (journal, weather, calendar).

## Implementation Roadmap

### 1. Responsive Design Overhaul

- [x] Audit current CSS for fixed widths, paddings, and font sizes.
- [x] Use CSS media queries to adapt layout for screens < 600px.
- [x] Stack controls vertically on mobile (e.g., location, units, search).
- [x] Make buttons and inputs at least 44x44px (Apple/Google guidelines). _(Double-check on device)_
- [x] Hide or collapse less-used controls/sections on mobile.
- [x] Ensure modals and overlays are full-screen on mobile.

### 2. Mobile Navigation Improvements

- [ ] Add a bottom navigation bar for main sections (Weather, Calendar, Journal, Search). _(Consider for future)_
- [x] Make the quick-jump menu collapsible or a hamburger menu on mobile.
- [x] Add a floating "+" button for quick journal entry/photo.

### 3. Photo Capture & Management

- [~] Update the journal entry form to use `<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">` for direct camera access. _(Input present, but missing `capture` attribute)_
- [x] Show photo previews in a swipeable carousel or grid. _(Grid previews present, not swipeable)_
- [x] Allow deleting/reordering photos before saving. _(Delete present, reordering not present)_
- [x] Optimize image size for upload/storage (client-side resizing).

### 4. Touch & Accessibility

- [x] Increase spacing between interactive elements.
- [x] Use larger, readable fonts.
- [x] Ensure all controls are accessible via screen readers and keyboard. _(ARIA labels present; review keyboard navigation for custom controls)_

### 5. Testing & QA

- [ ] Test on real devices (iOS/Android) and emulators. _(Manual step)_
- [ ] Check landscape/portrait modes. _(Manual step)_
- [x] Validate accessibility (contrast, ARIA labels, etc.). _(Manual validation recommended)_

## Key Next Steps
- Add `capture="environment"` to photo input for direct camera access.
- Consider implementing a bottom navigation bar for faster mobile navigation.
- Review and improve keyboard navigation for custom controls (FAB, menus).
- Test on real devices and in landscape/portrait modes.

## Example: Mobile-Friendly Journal Entry (HTML Snippet)

```html
<input
  type="file"
  id="entryPhotos"
  accept="image/*"
  capture="environment"
  multiple
  style="display: none;"
>
<!-- This enables direct camera access on mobile devices -->
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create a new branch for mobile improvements.**
2. **Start with CSS refactoring for responsiveness.**
3. **Update journal entry photo input and preview logic.**
4. **Iteratively test and refine on real devices.**

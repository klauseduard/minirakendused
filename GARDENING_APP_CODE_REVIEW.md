# 🌱 Gardening Calendar App — General Code Review

# 🚩 High-Priority Needs

## 1. Split Large Modules for Maintainability
- `journal.js` is over 1700 lines. Refactor into smaller modules (e.g., `journal-ui.js`, `journal-storage.js`, `journal-logic.js`).
- **Impact:** Easier future development, fewer bugs, better onboarding.
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Modules have been refactored and split.

## 2. Implement Lazy-Loading for Images
- Use `loading="lazy"` for `<img>` tags or JS-based lazy loading in galleries/timelines.
- **Impact:** Faster load times, better mobile performance, reduced data usage.
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Lazy loading added to all images in the application.

## 3. Accessibility: Ensure Full Keyboard Navigation
- Test all interactive elements with keyboard only; add/fix tab order and keyboard event handlers as needed.
- **Impact:** Broader usability, legal compliance, improved experience for all users.
- **Status:** 🟡 PARTIALLY COMPLETED - ARIA labels added, but needs keyboard navigation testing.

## 4. Automated Linting and Formatting
- Add ESLint and Prettier configs; run them on commit or in CI.
- **Impact:** Fewer style-related bugs, easier code reviews, more professional codebase.
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - ESLint and Prettier configured, with npm scripts for linting and formatting.

## 5. Automated Testing (Unit/Integration)
- Add basic unit tests for core modules (e.g., journal logic, storage, export/import).
- **Impact:** Increased reliability, confidence in refactoring, easier onboarding.
- **Status:** 🟡 PARTIALLY COMPLETED - Jest set up, initial unit tests for journal module created.

## 1. Project Structure & Modularity
- **Strengths:**
  - Clear separation of concerns: each feature (journal, calendar, weather, etc.) is in its own JS module.
  - Main entry (`main.js`) orchestrates initialization and exposes modules globally for backward compatibility.
  - HTML is well-structured, using semantic elements and clear sectioning.
- **Improvement:**
  - Consider using ES module imports/exports everywhere and avoid global `window` assignments for new code.
  - For very large modules (e.g., `journal.js` at 1700+ lines), consider further splitting into submodules (e.g., `journal-ui.js`, `journal-storage.js`).

## 2. Mobile Usability
- **Strengths:**
  - FAB and floating menus are context-aware and only visible in relevant views.
  - Touch targets are large and accessible.
  - Responsive design is handled via CSS and conditional logic.
- **Improvement:**
  - Test on a variety of devices for edge cases (e.g., iOS Safari quirks).
  - Consider lazy-loading images and heavy content for better performance on slow connections.

## 3. Image Handling
- **Strengths:**
  - All user-uploaded images are compressed (max width: 800px, JPEG quality: 0.7).
  - Thumbnails are generated for galleries.
  - No original, uncompressed images are stored or exported.
- **Improvement:**
  - Consider offering user feedback on image compression progress for large files.
  - Optionally, allow users to choose between different compression levels.

## 4. Accessibility
- **Strengths:**
  - All interactive elements have `aria-label` or visible text.
  - Modals are dismissible via Escape and outside click.
  - Visually hidden labels are used for form fields.
- **Improvement:**
  - Ensure all custom controls (e.g., FAB expansion, dropdowns) are keyboard-navigable.
  - Test with screen readers for full accessibility compliance.

## 5. UI/UX Consistency
- **Strengths:**
  - Consistent button styles, colors, and iconography.
  - Floating menus close on outside click or Escape.
  - Only one floating menu can be open at a time.
- **Improvement:**
  - Consider a design system or style guide for future contributors.

## 6. Performance
- **Strengths:**
  - Images are compressed before storage.
  - Large blobs are avoided in localStorage.
- **Improvement:**
  - Implement lazy-loading for images in galleries and timelines.
  - Monitor and optimize bundle size as the app grows.

## 7. Code Quality
- **Strengths:**
  - Modern JS (ES6+) is used throughout.
  - Functions are generally small and focused.
  - Non-obvious logic is commented, especially around image processing and export/import.
- **Improvement:**
  - Large modules (like `journal.js`) could be split for maintainability.
  - Consider adding automated linting (ESLint) and formatting (Prettier).

## 8. Testing & Debugging
- **Strengths:**
  - Features are tested on both desktop and mobile.
  - Export/import is checked with large journals.
- **Improvement:**
  - Add more automated tests (unit, integration) if possible.
  - Consider a test plan for major features.

## 9. Export/Import
- **Strengths:**
  - Exported JSON is as small as possible (no uncompressed images).
  - User guidance is provided for iOS export/import.
  - Users are warned about potential file size if images are included.
- **Improvement:**
  - Consider supporting cloud export/import (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) for users with limited local storage.

## 10. Future-Proofing
- **Strengths:**
  - Mobile-first and offline usability are considered.
  - Data format changes are documented.
- **Improvement:**
  - Consider PWA features for offline access and installability.

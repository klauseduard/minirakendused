# Mobile Usability Guidelines

- All interactive elements must be easily tappable (min 44x44px).
- Floating action buttons (FAB) should only be visible in their relevant context (e.g., Journal view).
- Use CSS media queries for mobile-specific layouts and controls.
- Avoid fixed-position elements that overlap important content on small screens.
- Bottom navigation should always be visible on mobile (â‰¤600px) for quick access to main sections.
- The Journal FAB button should be positioned at the bottom left above the navigation bar.
- Keep the header hidden on mobile to maximize screen space.
- Use proper terminology: "Schedule" instead of "Calendar," "Plants" instead of "Growing Period."
- Stack all content vertically on mobile for optimal readability.

- All interactive elements must be easily tappable (min 44x44px).
- Floating action buttons (FAB) should only be visible in their relevant context (e.g., Journal view).
- Use CSS media queries for mobile-specific layouts and controls.
- Avoid fixed-position elements that overlap important content on small screens.

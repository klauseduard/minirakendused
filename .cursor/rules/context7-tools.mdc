# Context 7 Documentation Tools

Use this guide whenever interacting with the Context 7 documentation helpers that surface real-time library docs.

1. ALWAYS invoke `resolve-library-id` first to obtain the exact Context 7-compatible library ID.
2. After you have the ID, call `get-library-docs` **once** with that same ID. Supply an optional `topic` or `tokens` value only when genuinely required.
3. If multiple IDs seem plausible, briefly explain why you picked one, then proceed with the single chosen ID.
4. When speaking to the user, never reveal the internal tool namesâ€”describe the action in natural language instead (e.g., "I'm fetching documentation for React hooks").
5. Follow the existing token-budget guidance: the default `tokens` parameter is usually sufficient; request more only when you truly need additional context.
6. These rules sit alongside the other domain-specific helpers (Elasticsearch, JIRA, etc.) for consistency.
